# How to start the application

First, you need to clone this repository, you can use this code in any CLI that supports GIT on your computer:

```
git clone https://github.com/IsaacHermel/advice-generator.git
```

After this, you need to access the app in the `/client` folder and run the following command in an terminal:

```
npm install
```

Ok, now you just need to start it, to this, run this command here:

```
npm start
```

If everything is okay, you should see a message like this by now:

```
Compiled successfully!

You can now view client in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000
  On Your Network:  http://<your_ip_address_here>:3000

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use npm run build.
```

PLUS: If you're a lazy person like me, just access the website that I hosted on Vercel:
